# Rule 1: No Cape, No Crime ✅

Full Autonomy Zone:

- Clearly documented (FAQ answers) {.fragment}
- Low stakes (no money, no legal stuff) {.fragment}
- Easily reversible (no harm if wrong) {.fragment}
- If outside scope → say "I don't know" and escalate {.fragment}

Example:
```text
Customer: "What are your business hours?"
Agent: "We're open Monday–Friday, 9am–5pm EST!"
```

<!-- NOTES: Only give autonomy in low-risk documented cases -->
