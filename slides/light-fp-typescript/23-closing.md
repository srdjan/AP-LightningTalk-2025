**Key Takeaway:** Functional programming in TypeScript doesn't require academic concepts or heavy frameworks. Start with pure functions, explicit errors, and simple patterns. Your code will be more reliable, testable, and maintainable.

<!-- NOTES: Emphasize that Light FP is accessible to everyone. You don't need a PhD in category theory. Just apply practical patterns that make your code better. -->
