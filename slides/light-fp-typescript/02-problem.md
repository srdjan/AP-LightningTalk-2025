# The Problem with Traditional TypeScript

## Common Pain Points

- **Testing Nightmare**: Mocking complex dependencies, fighting frameworks {.fragment}
- **Unpredictable Errors**: Try-catch everywhere, error handling inconsistent {.fragment}
- **Tight Coupling**: Business logic mixed with HTTP, DB, external APIs {.fragment}
- **Mutation Chaos**: Objects changed in unexpected places {.fragment}
- **Type Safety Illusion**: TypeScript types don't prevent logical errors {.fragment}

<!-- NOTES: Start with pain points developers actually experience. These are not theoretical - they're daily frustrations. -->
