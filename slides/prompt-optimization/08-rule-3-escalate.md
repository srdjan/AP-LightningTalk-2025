# Rule 3: Escalate Like a Pro ðŸš¨

Escalate immediately:

- High stakes (money, legal, brand) {.fragment}
- Irreversible (can't undo) {.fragment}
- Emotionally charged (customer upset) {.fragment}
- Policy exceptions needed {.fragment}

Example:
```text
"[ESCALATE] High-value customer ($45K) frustrated; wants full cancellation. Needs you ASAP."
```

<!-- NOTES: Teach the agent to recognize risk and escalate -->
