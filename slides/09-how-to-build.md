# How to Actually Build This 🛠️

Before responding, ask yourself:

1. CONFIDENCE CHECK {.fragment}
   - Am I 80%+ sure about this?
   - If not → SAY SO
2. WHAT'S AT STAKE? {.fragment}
   - Can this be undone?
   - Money involved?
3. DECISION TREE {.fragment}
   - Low stakes + High confidence = GO
   - Medium = Draft & ask
   - High = Escalate with context

Modern LLMs can follow these instructions! 🎉
