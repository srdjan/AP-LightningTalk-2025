# Real-World Examples

## Agents in Production

### Example 1: Code Review Agent

```
Input: Pull request URL
Tools: GitHub API, static analysis, test runner
Output: Inline comments + summary report
Autonomy: Suggest only (human merges)
```

**Impact**: 40% reduction in review cycle time {.fragment}

### Example 2: Customer Support Triage

```
Input: Support ticket
Tools: KB search, customer history, sentiment analysis
Output: Category + urgency + suggested response
Autonomy: Auto-respond to FAQ, escalate complex issues
```

**Impact**: 70% of tickets handled without human intervention {.fragment}

<!-- NOTES: Both examples follow the same pattern: clear inputs/outputs, well-defined tools, appropriate autonomy level. -->
